# PipeWrench [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cmccomb/PipeWrench.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cmccomb/PipeWrench)
A program that solves fluid networks using a finite element approach. The specific formulation assumes

  1. Laminar flow
  2. Negligible minor head losses

The underlying analysis software is compatible with both [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) and [Octave-4.0](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). The GUI is compatible with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).
